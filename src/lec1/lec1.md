Python is a high-level programming language that was created by [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io/) in 1991.   

It is named after the British television series **"Monty Python's Flying Circus"** that van Rossum was a fan of.   
</div>

<div class="fragment">

**Python 0.9.0(February 1991)**-The first official Python release, version 0.9.0 came out. This version included exception handling, functions, and modules.
</div>

<div class="fragment">

**Recent Developments(2020s)**: Python continues to evolve with regular releases. Python 3.10 was the latest stable version, but subsequent releases are expected to bring further enhancements and features.

Python is an **object-oriented**, open-source programming language often used for rapid application development.
</div>

<div class="fragment">

Python's simple syntax amphasizes readability, reducing the costof program mantenance, while its large library of functions and calls encourages reuse and extensibility.
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="col-7">

<div class="fragment">

python is known for its simplicity, readability, and flexibility, and is often used for **scripting, web development** and **data science**. 
</div>

<div class="fragment">

Python features **dynamic typing**, which means that variables can hold any type of data, such as **integers**, **floats**, **strings** or even other **objects**.
</div>

<div class="fragment">

It also uses **indentation** to define code blocks, which makes the code clean and easy to read. 
</div>

<div class="fragment">

Python has a **large standard library** that contains many common functions and modules for tasks such as **file I/O**, **network programming**and **cryptography**.

# Why more and more people are learning Python?

## Reasons

</div>

<div class="col-6">

<div class="fragment">

Python is an **interpreted language**, which means that the source code is interpreted directly by the Python interpreter instead of being compiled into machine code. 
</div>

<div class="fragment">

This makes Python development efficient and easy to debug, but also makes it easier for beginners to learn and use. 
</div>

<div class="fragment">

Python supports **modules** and **packages** that allow programmers to organize their code into separate files and directories and reuse it easily.
</div>
</div>
